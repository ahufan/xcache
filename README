XCACHE

Introduction
	xcache is based on ccache. It can store the outputs of compile into remote servers.
It consists of several components:
	xcache
A new in-memory database which has high efficiency. All the outputs of compile will be stored in it.
	xcache_client
It’s just the ccache with the capability to communicate with the xcache
	xcache_monitor
The monitor of the xcache

How to build
cd server && make -j
cd client && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make -j

You can find:
xcache and xcache_monitor under the directory of server
xcache_client under the the directory of server



How to use:
Single Mode
1.	Setup the xcache on remote server which is 127.0.0.1. We will run:
xcache –d –c –p 20190 –m 1
	The parameter -d means to run as a daemon.
	The parameter -c means to generate a core file when xcache crashed.
	The parameter –m 1 means to set the original memory of the database to 1G.You can change the value by yourself.
	The parameter –p 20190 means to set the port to 20190. You can change the value you like.
	You can run xcache –h to see another parameters available.
2.	Setup the xcache_client, Please run any one of the following commands.
export CCACHE_REMOTE_CONF="—SERVER=127.0.0.1:20190 10"
	The value 10 is the xcache_core, please see the distribute cluster mode below.
3.	Run the ccache to compile
xcache_client gcc test.c -c -o test.o

Distributed Cluster Mode
1.	Setup the xcache on remote server which is 127.0.0.1. We will run two databases.
xcache –d –c –p 20190 –m 1
xcache –d –c –p 20191 –m 1
	The parameter -d means to run as a daemon.
	The parameter -c means to generate a core file when xcache crashed.
	The parameter –m 1 means to set the original memory of the database to 1G.You can change the value by yourself.
	The parameter –p 20190 means to set the port to 20190. You can change the value you like.
	You can run xcache –h to see another parameters available.

2.	Setup the proxy on remote server which is 127.0.0.1. Please run: 
xcache –d –c –p 6666 -P
	The parameter –P means to change the xcache to a proxy which has a high priority.

3.	Tell the proxy about the information of the xcache. Please run :
xcache_monitor –S 127.0.0.1:20191["—SERVER=127.0.0.1:20190 10 —SERVER=127.0.0.1:20191 10"]
	The format of command is like: 
xcache_monitor –S proxy_ip:proxy_port["—SERVER=xcache_ip:xcache_port xcache_core"]
4.	The xcache_core means the power of the database. The one which has bigger xcache_core would store more data than others.
5.	Setup the xcache_client.
If you don’t use the proxy, please run:
export CCACHE_REMOTE_CONF="—SERVER=127.0.0.1:20190 10 —SERVER=127.0.0.1:20191 10" 
If you use the proxy, please run one of the following commands:
export CCACHE_REMOTE_CONF="—PROXY=127.0.0.1:6666"
export CCACHE_REMOTE_CONF=`xcache_monitor -G 127.0.0.1:6666 | tail -1 | grep "SERVER="` 
6.	Run the ccache to compile
xcache_client gcc test.c -c -o test.o
